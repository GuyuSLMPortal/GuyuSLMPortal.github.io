							<h1>DEAD LEVEL CONTOUR</h1>

							<H1>Description</H1>
							<p> 	Dead level contours, also known as contour bunds, are a soil conservation technique used by farmers in Zimbabwe 
								to prevent soil erosion and improve soil moisture retention. Dead level contours involve the construction of bunds or 
								ridges along the contour lines of the land. These bunds are built with a dead level, meaning that they are constructed without a slope,
								 and are therefore able to hold water in place. To create dead level contours, farmers use simple hand tools such as hoes and shovels 
								 to dig small trenches along the contour lines of the land. They then use the soil dug from the trenches to build up the bunds,
								 creating a barrier to slow the flow of water and prevent soil erosion</p>
							<H1>Dimensions of an infiltration trench, swale or dead-level contour</H1>
							<p>Approximate Dimensions (in metres):
								<li>Depth: 0.15 - 0.20 metres</li>
								<li>Width: 0.30 â€“ 0.45 metres</li>
								<li>Length: Varies depending on site conditions and the volume of rainfall runoff</li>
								<li>Slope: 0% (dead level) </li>
							</p>
							<H1>Site Selection:</H1>
							<p>Select an area on a gentle slope where rainwater runoff is causing soil erosion.
								 Ensure the site is on a natural contour line with a zero gradient.
								 This allows for the construction of a series of dead level contours that will store water and promote 
								 infiltration into the soil.</p>

								</p>
								<H1>Design::</H1>
								<p>Dead level contours must be constructed along the natural level lines of the land.
									 This can be achieved using tools like a dumpy level or an 'A' frame. The length and width of each contour depend 
									 on the expected volume of runoff. A general rule of thumb is to provide 3 to 4.5 meters of contour per 90 square meters of
									  surface area. 
									Ensure the bottom of the contour is level and the sides have a gentle slope, not steeper than 1:2 (horizontal to vertical)..</p>
