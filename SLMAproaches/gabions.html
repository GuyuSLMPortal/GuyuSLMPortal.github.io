							<H1>Description</H1>
							<p>A gabion is a container for rocks used where the flow of water would overtop 
								or wash away other soil retention and water infiltration systems.  
								Gabions are usually constructed across existing gulleys where there 
								is a high flow of water and thus must be firmly anchored to be kept in place.  A gabion comprises a rectangular frame or cage typically formed from 2.4 x 6 metre weldmesh sheets with 4 mm wire and 100 x 100 mm apertures.  Suitable dimensions of the frames are a width of 0.6 m and 0.8 m height.  The frames are filled with stones and rocks and closed at the top with an additional strip of weldmesh to ensure the rocks remain in place.  The frames are placed in a shallow trench across a waterway where erosion is occurring and extend beyond the sides of the waterway to ensure water does not flow around the ends of the gabion, which would then wash away soil, defeating the purpose of the gabion and increasing the width of the gully.  Where the gully is deep, two or three gabions may be placed on top of each other in a stepped formation.  
								The gabion reduces the velocity of the water as it flows between the
								 loose rock in the gabion so that the sediment in transport is deposited
								  upstream of the gabion.</p>
								  <p>In this way gabions are effective erosion 
								  control structures that accumulate sediment to fill up gulleys and prevent
								   the siltation of dams and weirs. They are particularly useful in dam
								    catchment and badly degraded areas. They allow water to flow through them,
									 reducing water runoff velocity thereby increasing infiltration which
									  promotes soil moisture retention in the catchment area. Over time, 
									  the growth of vegetation within the catchment area enhances the 
									  erosion control properties of gabions, ultimately contributing 
									  to land reclamation.
								</p>
							<H1>Method: </H1>
							<p>Approximate Dimensions (in metres):
								<li>	Identify an appropriate site for a gabion.</li>
								<li>	Measure the width of the gully.</li>
								<li>	Mark the gabion foundation. (typically 0.7 metres wide x 0.2 metres deep), ensure the foundation extends into the sides of the gully so that when the gabion is installed each end will be higher than the gabion as it crosses the gully to prevent water flow around the ends. </li>
								<li>	Dig a shallow foundation trench: </li>
								<li>-	The foundation trench plays a crucial role in providing stability, load distribution and overall
									 structural integrity of the gabion structure.
							    <li>-	The trench should be at least 0.2m deep and 0.7m wide across the gulley and into the sides 
									to provide stability for the gabion. </li>

								<li>	The foundation trench should be dug to allow 3 or 4 metres of the gabion to be anchored on each side of the gulley banks to prevent 
									water from flowing around the ends of the gabion that would create erosion. .</li>
								</li>
							</p>
							<H1>Note:</H1>
							<li>	The trench should be wider than the base width of the gabion and deep enough to allow effective anchoring.</li>
							<li>	The gabion must extend beyond the width of the gully   </li>
							<li>	The gully can be seen in the mid-ground with people digging a foundation on the side of the gully.
