							<h1>Half-moons</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/hm.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<H1>Description</H1>
							<p>Half-moons, also known as semi-circular bunds are water-harvesting structures used to capture and retain rainfall on rangeland and in agricultural fields. They are designed to capture large volumes of water to infiltrate into the soil to increase the quantity of water to plants, extend the period of available moisture and generally to reduce runoff and soil erosion. Half-moons are typically constructed in semi-circular shapes along the contour lines of sloping land to
								 maximize water retention and to promote plant growth, typically perennial plants.</p>
								  <p>In this way gabions are effective erosion 
								  control structures that accumulate sediment to fill up gulleys and prevent
								   the siltation of dams and weirs. They are particularly useful in dam
								    catchment and badly degraded areas. They allow water to flow through them,
									 reducing water runoff velocity thereby increasing infiltration which
									  promotes soil moisture retention in the catchment area. Over time, 
									  the growth of vegetation within the catchment area enhances the 
									  erosion control properties of gabions, ultimately contributing 
									  to land reclamation.

							<H1>Dimensions: </H1>
							<p>
								<li>	Determine the radius and the spacing of the half-moons based on the slope of the land and of sufficient size to retain the runoff water from a storm.  </li>
								<li>	A typical radius will be 1.5 to 2 metres making the width of the half-moon 3 to 4 metres.</li>
							</p>
							<H1>Site selection:</H1>
							<li>	Each half-moon is placed between the two half-moons above it –
								 so they overlap each other to ensure that all runoff water is trapped within a half-moon basin.  The distance between the adjacent half-moon and
								 the line of half-moons above will be approximately equal to the radius of each half-moon</li>

							<H1>Design:</H1>
							<li>	Each half-moon is placed between the two half-moons above it –
								 so they overlap each other to ensure that all runoff water is trapped within a half-moon basin.  The distance between the adjacent half-moon and
								 the line of half-moons above will be approximately equal to the radius of each half-moon</li>
								 <li>	•	Mark an initial line roughly on the contour.</li>
								 <li>	•	Tie two pegs together so they are the radius of the half-moon apart. </li>
								 <li>	•	Drive one peg into the soil along the contour line and scribe a half circle with the other peg. </li>
								 <li>	•	The distance between each half-moon should be approximately the radius of each half-moon. .</li>
								  
							
							<p>
							</p>
							<H1>Method:</H1>
							     <li>	    	Excavate a trench on the marked semi-circular line, ensuring a consistent width and depth throughout.</li>
								 <li>	    	Place the soil dug from the half-moon trench to create a small bank on the lower, the outside of the half-moon. 
									            The trench and bank will harvest water within the half-moon and will stop erosion on the slope. </li>
								 <li>	    	Plants can be placed within the half-moon and on the bank to utilise the harvested water and stabilise the bank,
									            promote water infiltration and prevent erosion. Select plants or grasses that establish well in the area. </li>
