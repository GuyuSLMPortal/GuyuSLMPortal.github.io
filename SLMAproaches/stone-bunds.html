							<H1>Description</H1>
							<p>Stone bunds are structures constructed across a slope to slow the flow of water so that 
								eroded soil particles carried in flowing water are deposited. They are built along contour lines so
								 there is no accumulation of water that could cause erosion, and runoff rainfall is infiltrated into the soil to
								  recharge groundwater.  </p>
								  <p>They are effective soil conservation measures used in areas with a slight slope, 5% or less.
									Water should flow through the spaces between
								  the stones and rocks of the bund which slows the flow to allow infiltration and eroded soil particles to be deposited.
								</p>
							<H1>Dimensions: </H1>
							<p>
								<li>	Height: 0.30 – 0.60 metres </li>
								<li>	Width: 0.5 – 1.00 metre (varies with slope gradient)</li>
								<li>	Materials: Use available materials, ideally large rocks at the base with smaller rocks on top</li>

							</p>
							<H1>Site selection:</H1>
							<li>	Conduct a site assessment to identify the slope of the land, 
								    the direction of surface water flow, the soil type and the positioning of lines of bunds and the distance apart.</li>
								<li> Determine the dimensions and layout of the bunds based on the site's characteristics and the anticipated volume of 
									runoff water to be managed. </li>
								<li> Clear debris along the contour line where the stone bund will be constructed. </li>
								<li> 4.	Mark out each contour line using an A frame or line level.  The line can be adjusted slightly to allow the bunds
									 to form an even regular line. 
									Put smaller stones on the higher side of the trench and use them to fill large gaps between rocks and large stones. </li>
